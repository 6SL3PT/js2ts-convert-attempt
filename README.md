# JS to TS Attempt
This repositories is created for practice & self-studying purpose.
A simple scripts to try convert from **JavaScript** of my previous project to **TypeScript**,
I have to remove some features because I can't find a way to convert it to Typescript.

My original file is at another repository (name: 'expressjs_simpleREST_practice'),
you can look up for it if you interested.

I'm still at the beginners level, if you have any advice I'm willing to expand my knowledge.
